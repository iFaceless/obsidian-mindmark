## MySQL Architecture

### Storage Engines
MySQL supports multiple storage engines, each with different characteristics and use cases.

#### InnoDB
The default and most widely used storage engine in MySQL 5.7+.

- **ACID Compliant**: Supports transactions with commit, rollback, and crash recovery
- **Row-level Locking**: Provides high concurrency for multi-user environments
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforces referential integrity between tables
- **Crash Recovery**: Automatic recovery after system failures
- **MVCC**: Multi-Version Concurrency Control for non-blocking reads
- **Use Cases**: Transactional applications, e-commerce, financial systems

#### MyISAM
Legacy storage engine, still available but not recommended for new applications.

- **Table-level Locking**: Limits concurrency in write-heavy workloads
- **No Transactions**: Does not support ACID transactions
- **Fast Reads**: Optimized for read-heavy workloads
- **Full-text Search**: Built-in full-text indexing capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Read-only data, archival data, legacy applications

#### Memory
Stores all data in RAM for extremely fast access.

- **In-memory Storage**: All data resides in memory
- **Fast Performance**: Extremely fast for temporary data
- **Data Loss**: Data is lost when server restarts
- **Hash Indexes**: Only supports hash indexes
- **Use Cases**: Temporary tables, cache, session data

### Query Execution
MySQL processes queries through a well-defined execution pipeline.

#### Query Parser
Transforms SQL text into an internal structure.

- **Syntax Validation**: Checks SQL syntax correctness
- **Permission Verification**: Validates user access rights
- **Query Cache**: Checks if query result is cached (MySQL 5.7)
- **Parse Tree**: Creates internal representation of the query

#### Optimizer
Determines the most efficient execution plan.

- **Cost-based Optimization**: Evaluates multiple execution plans
- **Index Selection**: Chooses optimal indexes for query
- **Join Order**: Determines best table join sequence
- **Statistics**: Uses table and index statistics
- **Query Rewrite**: Transforms queries for better performance

#### Execution Engine
Executes the query according to the execution plan.

- **Handler API**: Interface to storage engines
- **Row Operations**: Reads and modifies rows
- **Buffer Pool**: Caches data and index pages
- **Lock Management**: Acquires and releases locks
- **Transaction Management**: Handles transaction boundaries

### Replication
MySQL supports various replication topologies for high availability and scalability.

#### Master-Slave Replication
Traditional one-way replication from master to slaves.

- **Asynchronous**: Master does not wait for slave acknowledgment
- **Binary Log**: Records all data changes on master
- **Relay Log**: Slaves copy and execute from relay log
- **Read Scaling**: Distributes read queries across slaves
- **Backup**: Slaves can be used for backup without affecting master

#### Group Replication
Multi-master replication with conflict detection and resolution.

- **Synchronous**: All members acknowledge transactions
- **Automatic Failover**: Automatic primary election on failure
- **Conflict Detection**: Detects and resolves update conflicts
- **Consensus**: Uses Paxos-based consensus protocol
- **High Availability**: No single point of failure

#### InnoDB Cluster
Complete high availability solution combining multiple MySQL technologies.

- **MySQL Router**: Automatic routing of client connections
- **Group Replication**: Underlying replication technology
- **MySQL Shell**: Administration and management interface
- **Automatic Scaling**: Add or remove nodes dynamically
- **Disaster Recovery**: Built-in backup and recovery tools

### Performance Optimization
Techniques and strategies to optimize MySQL performance.

#### Indexing
Proper indexing is crucial for query performance.

- **B-Tree Indexes**: Default index type, efficient for range queries
- **Hash Indexes**: Only in Memory engine, fast for exact matches
- **Full-text Indexes**: For text search across columns
- **Composite Indexes**: Multiple columns in a single index
- **Covering Indexes**: Index contains all columns needed by query

#### Query Optimization
Writing efficient queries is as important as proper indexing.

- **SELECT Specific Columns**: Avoid SELECT *
- **Use WHERE**: Filter rows early in execution
- **Avoid Functions in WHERE**: Prevents index usage
- **JOIN Optimization**: Use appropriate join types
- **Subquery vs JOIN**: Often JOIN performs better
- **LIMIT**: Use for pagination to reduce result set

#### Configuration Tuning
MySQL configuration parameters significantly impact performance.

- **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: Most important parameter, set to 70-80% of RAM
- **innodb_log_file_size**: Larger files reduce I/O but increase recovery time
- **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Trade-off between durability and performance
- **max_connections**: Maximum concurrent client connections
- **query_cache_size**: Cache query results (MySQL 5.7)

### Security
Protecting MySQL databases from unauthorized access and attacks.

#### Authentication
MySQL supports multiple authentication methods.

- **Native Password**: Traditional MySQL authentication
- **Caching SHA2 Password**: Default in MySQL 8.0, more secure
- **SHA256 Password**: Stronger encryption, requires SSL
- **External Authentication**: LDAP, PAM, Windows authentication

#### Privileges
Granular access control for database users.

- **GRANT**: Grant specific privileges to users
- **REVOKE**: Remove privileges from users
- **Roles**: Group multiple privileges together
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
- **Regular Audits**: Review and update user permissions regularly

#### Data Encryption
Protect data at rest and in transit.

- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypt connections between client and server
- **Data-at-Rest Encryption**: Encrypt tablespace and log files
- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**: Automatic encryption of data files
- **Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of encryption keys
