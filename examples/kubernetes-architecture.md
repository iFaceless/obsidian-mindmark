# Kubernetes Architecture

- Control Plane Components
  - API Server
    - Serves as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane
    - Exposes the Kubernetes API
    - Validates and configures data for API objects
    - Handles REST operations
  - etcd
    - Consistent and highly-available key value store
    - Stores all cluster data
    - Provides watch mechanism for configuration changes
  - Scheduler
    - Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node
    - Selects a node for them to run on
    - Considers resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints
    - Affinity and anti-affinity specifications
    - Data locality, inter-workload interference, deadlines
  - Controller Manager
    - Runs controller processes
    - Node Controller
      - Notices and responds when nodes go down
      - Manages node lifecycle
    - Replication Controller
      - Maintains correct number of pods
      - Ensures desired state
    - Endpoints Controller
      - Populates the Endpoints object
      - Connects Services to Pods
    - Service Account & Token Controllers
      - Create default accounts and API access tokens

- Node Components
  - Kubelet
    - Primary node agent
    - Receives PodSpecs from API Server
    - Ensures containers described in PodSpecs are running
    - Reports node and pod status to API Server
  - Kube-proxy
    - Network proxy
    - Maintains network rules on nodes
    - Implements Kubernetes Service concept
    - Handles TCP, UDP, SCTP streams
  - Container Runtime
    - Software responsible for running containers
    - Supports Docker, containerd, CRI-O
    - Manages container lifecycle
  - kubelet
    - Works with container runtime
    - Pulls images
    - Starts and stops containers

- Addons
  - DNS
    - Serves DNS records for Kubernetes Services
    - Required for cluster functionality
  - Dashboard
    - Web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters
    - Deploys and containerized applications
    - Manages cluster resources
  - Cluster-level Logging
    - Centralized logging infrastructure
    - Stores container logs
    - No storage backend specified
  - Cluster-level Monitoring
    - Tracks cluster health
    - Monitors resource usage
    - Provides metrics and alerts

- Core Concepts
  - Pod
    - Smallest deployable unit
    - Contains one or more containers
    - Shared storage and network
    - Runs on a single node
  - Service
    - Abstracts pod IP addresses
    - Provides stable network endpoint
    - Enables service discovery
    - Supports load balancing
  - Volume
    - Data directory accessible to containers
    - Outlives containers
    - Supports multiple storage backends
    - Provides data persistence
  - Namespace
    - Virtual cluster
    - Enables resource isolation
    - Supports multiple teams
    - Divides cluster resources
